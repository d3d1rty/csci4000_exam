#Assignment 5 - CSCI 2070 (APSU)
##About
This project is an assignment for CSCI 2070 (Intro to Java) course at APSU. Being this is an educational project for a grade, collaboration isn't exactly the goal here. But if you feel that you can benefit from perusing my code, go for it! 

##What it Does
This project is a collection of small introductory classes.

##Usage
Compile with `javac` and run with `java`. Each class is standalone.

##Dependencies
JDK 8

##Academic Honesty
Please, just keep in mind that academic dishonesty is probably (definitely) not tolerated by your educational institution, so come up with your own solutions. Besides, I sincerely doubt that your assignment has the same requirements as mine, so you will probably look like an idiot if you try to turn this in.

##Credits
No outside assistance on this.

##Questions/Comments/Concerns
If you have any questions regarding this project, send me a message and I'd be more than happy to explain my code.
